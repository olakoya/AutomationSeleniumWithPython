Division (/) operator always performs floating point arithmetic. Hence always returns float value.

Floor division (//) can perform both floating point and integral arithmetic. 
If "arguements" are "int" type then "result" wiil be in "int" type too.
If at least one arguement is float type then result is float type.

Modulo (%) operator always return remainder.
