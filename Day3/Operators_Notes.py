Operators in Python:
--------------------
Operators is a symbol which will perform some operations between operands or variables e.g arithemetric, condition, assignment etc.
With the help of symbols it will perform an operations

Types of Operators:
-------------------

1. Arithmetic Operators 
(Example to Arihhmetic operators with descriptions: +:addition, -:subraction, *:multiplication, /:division, //:floor division, %:modulo division, **:exponent operator or power operator)

2. Relational Operators or Comparision Operators (When you perform relational operators you get a comparison operators)
When you perform an operations with two objects it's called relational operator becuase it's impossible to perform operation with just an object
Operator       |           Description
    >                      Greater Than
    >=                     Greater Than or Equal To
    <                      Less Than
    <=                     Less Than or Equal To

Relational operators and Comparison operators will always returns Boolean value (True or Flase) once it performs is operations

Comparision on strings is based on ascii code e.g
a = "John"
b = "Ram"
print (ord('J')) character and acsii code is "74"
print (ord('R')) character and acsii code is "82"

Always for True ==> Boolean value is 1
Always for False ==> Boolean value is 0

It is important to know that Chaining of Relational operators is also possible

3. Equality Operators
Operator       |            Description
    ==                      Equal
    !=                      Not Equal

4. Logical Operators

5. Bitwise Operators

6. Assignments Operators

7. Special Operators (This is to check the presence)
    7a. Membership Operators (use this to check the sequence of an item)
    7b. Identity Operators (Tocheck address of two address you use the operators)

8. Ternary Operators

Above are all the types of operators in python
