Flow Control or Control Statements in Python
---------------------------------------------
A flow control decides orders in which statements need to be executed
Only few statment can be executed in all statement

Types of Statements
-------------------
1. Conditional Statements
2. Transfer Statements
3. Iterative Statements or 
4. Looping Statements

Conditional Statements
-----------------------
When we talk about Conditional Statemnet we need to specify some conditions and that condition is Logical or Expressions conditions

E.g of Logical Statements are;
       --------------------
        Equals: a == b
        Not Equals: a != b
        Less than: a < b
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
        Greater than: a > b
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b

There are different types of Conditional Statments and examples are;
1. if
2. if-else
3. if-elif-else
4. nested if-else

Based on some conditions you perform some actions and those actions are powerful statements
Logical conditions or expressions will return a boolean value when performed

if or simple if statement
-------------------------
if condition (is True): (you need to perform an action)
Action can be a statement
We can have multiple statements e.g statment 1, statement 2, statement 3 etc. and they are simply group together 
if condition is True statement it will be executed inside the "if or simple if" statement otherwise it won't be executed
for every ststement in python


if-else statement requires mutiple actions
------------------
if condition:
    Action-1
else:
Action-2
'''

'''
To specify multiple conditions we go for;

if-elif-else statement
----------------------
if condition-1: is True
    Action-1 will be executed
else condition-2:
    Action-2 will be executed    
elif condition-3:
    Action-3 will be executed
else: 
    Default Action (i.e if the other first "if and else" statments are not true)

In Java we can switch statement but not in Python hence using thr above "if" statements

else plug is always optional and based on 

'''
'''
nested if-else statement
-------------------------

else part is always optional hence, the following are various possible syntaxes
        if
        if-else
        if-elif-else
        if-elif
The above are 4 types of the if conditional statement.
There is no switch statement in Python
