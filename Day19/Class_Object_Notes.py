Class and Object
----------------

Types of Object Oriented Programming Languages Principles (OOPS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Class and object
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulations


Types/Structures of Programming Langugages
-------------------------------------------
1. Structured: This programe doesn't support object oriented programming principles => C, Python
2. Object Based: This supports only class and object => VB, VBScript, Python
3. Object Oriented: This supports OOPS ==> Java, C++, C##, Python

In Python, without creating a class one can write a code.
ALso with class and object one can write a code in Python.
Python is fully object oriented programming language.

Class
------
Class is nothing but a design of blueprint
A blueprint is a design called a class
In Python everything is treated as an object therefore, we need to create an objec
To create an object one needs a blueprint
Blueprint is a logical entity that is, it will not occupy space in the memory 
Except for physical entities and that will only occupy some space in the memory
If you want to build a house we need a design
The design document will occupy some space
And this design document is nothing but a class which is a blueprint logical memory
That is it wouldn't occup any space in the memory
You create an object and that object is your house
The house consists of bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, toilet etc and as such one will require some requirements/properties
A class contains properties and operations
With the help of a blueprint one will create an object
From Object there will be a specification
And those specifications are called properties and operations of an object
These properties are also called attributes while operations can be called actions
With the help of class one creates an object and for the object one will have some specific properties
Class consists of variables and methods. In blueprint we specify variables and objects
Properties or Attributes of objects are called Variables
'''

Object
-------
Object is a physical existence of a class
Object will occupy any space in the memory
We create a class with a def keyword

Syntax
------
    i. We create a keyword ==> class
    ia. Class returns consists of "Documentation string" and just a comment which is optional
    ii. Followed by class name ==> class_name
    iii. Inside class we have varaibles ==> variables
    iv. And methods of an object ==> methods
How to call a function? We need a function name with an open and close parenthesis ==> class_name()
We call a class with the help of class_name and  open and close parentheses ()
If we want to specify the object we call the class name
We need a physical existence of a class to create an object.
Function is an entry point and call it with the help of keyword
And calling the class is creating an object

        class class_name: # class creation
                "documentation string"
                variables
                methods
        
        class name() # class calling => object of a particular class
'''

Method
-------
Method is a function created inside a class

self is a parameter which is referring to class where the method is defined

Once we create a class we can create any number of objects and this objects are independent

To objects we can give reference and this is independent 

With the help of refrence variable we call variables and methods of object
