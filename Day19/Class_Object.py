Class and Object
----------------

Types of Object Oriented Programming Languages Principles (OOPS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Class and object
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulations


Types/Structures of Programming Langugages
-------------------------------------------
1. Structured: This programe doesn't support object oriented programming principles => C, Python
2. Object Based: This supports only class and object => VB, VBScript, Python
3. Object Oriented: This supports OOPS ==> Java, C++, C##, Python

In Python, without creating a class one can write a code.
ALso with class and object one can write a code in Python.
Python is fully object oriented programming language.

Class
------
Class is nothing but a blueprint
A blueprint is a design called a class
In Python everything is treated as an object therefore, we need to create an objec
To create an object one needs a blueprint
Blueprint is a logical entity that is, it will not occupy space in the memory 
Except for physical entities and that will only occupy some space in the memory
If you want to build a house we need a design
The design document will occupy some space
And this design document is nothing but a class which is a blueprint logical memory
That is it wouldn't occup any space in the memory
You create an object and that object is your house
The house consists of bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, toilet etc and as such one will require some requirements/properties
A class contains properties and operations
With the help of a blueprint one will create an object
From Object there will be a specification
And those specifications are called properties and operations of an object
These properties are also called attributes while operations can be called actions
With the help of class one creates an object and for the object one will have some specific properties
