Modules and Packages in Python
-------------------------------
We are going to import alots anytime we are automating

Function is a set of statements upon calling will perform a certain task

Class is a blueporint which is a collection of Variables and Methods of an object

Modules consists of Functions and Classes

Package is a collection of Modules

Hierarchy
---------
Packages consists of ==> Modules
Modules consists of ==> Classes and Functions

Modules are python files with .py extensions e.g Selenium Webdriver 
With a help of functions and classes we are able to write automation scripts

Packages are also Library

Selenium is a ==> Package
Webdriver is a ==> Module

Therefore, inside Selenium Package Webdriver Module is found

Directory vs Package
---------------------
1. DIRECTORY
    Directory is like a folder on computer file system
    It contains any type of files e.g txt, exl, doc etc files
    A file that doesn't require any special requirements
    It's a basic way to organise files

2. PACKAGE
    Package is also a directory or folder
    It is a special type of directory
    It can only be used for specific purpose
    It is only use to store python files i.e. .py files which are called modules
    Constructor file (_ _init_ _.py) is created inside of package by default i.e 
    module is automatically created inside of package
    .py file can only be kept in the package file
    Dot notation is seen after a package is created
    It is use to manage python project 
    It's a Hierarchical way for structuring code

Types of approach to call/import Functions from one Module to another Module?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Approach 1 is from ==> import (this is a key to import from one module to another) module name
2. Approach 2 is from ==> from modulename import functions, classes
3. Approach 3 is from ==> from modulename import * (* means all)

E.g abc.py is a module and it consists of functions by the def keyword
    Also classes for private attributes
    Methods as well

    Creating a module called calculator by adding a new file inside of this Day 31 Package

Another type is call Functions having the same Name from different Modules
