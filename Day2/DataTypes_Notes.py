Data Types in Python:
----------------------
There are lots of data types in python.
Data Type represents the type of data present inside a variable.
In python we are not required to specify the type explicity . 
Based on value provided, the type will be assigned automatically, hence python is dynamically Typed language.

Python contains several inbuilt functions:
-------------------------------------------
1. type() => to check the type of variable
2. id() => to get address of object
3. print() => to print the value
In python everything is an object including dot (.), (,) etc. anything is treated as an object in python

Python Data Types are:
-----------------------
Numbers: Int | Float | Complex
Boolean: True | False
Sequence: String | List | Tuple
Mapping: Dict
Sets: Set | FrozenSet
