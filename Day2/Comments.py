# Comments
# They are descriptions about application logics
# It's also make a code maintenance easy
# It's a non-executable codes
# Python will ignore comments during run time

# How to specify single line comments and multi line comment

# To create a functions
#-----------------------
# E.g We can create a function by using the "def" keyword
# Def function will be used to call parameters, accepting and all

def my_func(): # this is single line function
    print("Hello world") # This "def" function has some statements which is "Print hello world" ie print is specifying a statement
my_func()
'''
Output is 
Hello world
'''
# To call the function click on the run button to run the code
# When the above "def" is called , it will execute the "print" statement, and the statement has some simple english letter and "hello world"
# The above is just a simple python program (code). It is a single line comment

# To specify a single line comment:
# Single line comment ==> ctrl or command+/ or #
# Multi line comment ==> """" or ''''
# Simple python program ==> is a single line comment
