Identifiers
-------------
A name in pyhton is called Identifiers
Class name, Function Name, Method Name, Variable Name, Module Name or Package Name are all identifiers

Rules for Creating Identifiers
-------------------------------
The only allowed characters for identifiers are
    alphabet symbols (lower (a,b,c) or upper case(A,B,C))
    digits (0 to 9) digits can't be used as a beginner
    underscore score(_)
Dollar($) sysmbol is not allowed in python and it's a special symbol
Identifier should not start wih digits
    name = "John" John is a variable name
identifiers are case sensitive e.g
    a = 10
    A = 20
    Based on case the value is access and returned
We should not use reserved (keywords) words as identifiers or creative names

name ==> starts with _symbol ==> private (Attribute that starts with underscore )
name ==> starts with _ _ symbol ==> strongly private
Magic method starts with double underscores symbols e.g _ _ add _ _ ==> magic methods (can't be override)
Identifier can't be created randomly. There should be some meaning to a name. 
To create a name one needs to follow some rules. 
Only an old member characters that are alphabet symbols begin with an underscore
Keywords are sensitive functionality
