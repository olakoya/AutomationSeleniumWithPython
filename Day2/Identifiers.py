Identifiers

A name in pyhton is called Identifiers
Class name or Function Name or Method Name or Variable Name or Module Name or Package Name

Rules for Creating Identifiers

Their only allowed characters are
    alphabet symbols (lower or upper case)
    digits (0 to 9) digits can't be used as a beginer
    underscore score(_)
Dollar($) sysmbol is not allowed in python and it's a special symbol
Identifier should not start wih digits
    name = "John" John is a variable name
identifiers are case sensitive e.g
    a = 10
    A = 20
    Based on case the value is access and returned
We should not use reserved (keywords) words as identifiers or creative names

name ==> starts with _symbol ==> private (Attribute that starts with underscore )
name ==> starts with _ _ symbol ==> strongly private
Magic method starts with double underscores symbols e.g _ _ add _ _ ==> magic methods (can't be override)
Identifier can't be created randomly. There should be some meaning to a name. 
To create a name one needs to follow some rules. Only an old member characters that are alphabet symbols begins with an underscore
Keywords are sensitive functionality
