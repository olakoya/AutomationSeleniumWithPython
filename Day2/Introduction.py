Python is general purpose high level Programming language.
It is a Case sensitive Programming language.
	x = 10

History of Python
-----------------
Python Implementation started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Netherlands.
The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show 
and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! 
In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0).
In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.
On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. 

Python is influenced by
------------------------
Functional programming features is from C
Object Oriented Programming Features is from C++
Scripting Language Features is from Perl and Shell Script
Modular Programming Features is from Modula-3
	
Ways to run a Python code
------------------------
IDLE (Python shell)
Command Prompt
notepad/notepad++

Python IDE ==> Pycharm Community Edition

.py files are called as modules

simple python program
